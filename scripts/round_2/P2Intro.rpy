"How on earth did I get into this mess?"
"I'm somehow stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere, in an insane dating show from hell."
"From what Kat said, I'm dead meat if I can't finish this show with a fianc√©e, or if the ratings aren't high enough."
"None of the girls on the show know the truth, and if they found out... they'd kill all of us."
"Why couldn't I wake up with no memories in a regular hospital, like a regular drama protagonist?"
"At least the girls seemed nice."
"Allie's quite something. Something tells me she'll be hard to keep up with, and that's not just from losing a race to her in the field."
"Scarlett's... interesting. I've still got no idea if she was trying to read the magazine, or the book hiding it."
"...I'll figure that out later."
"Terra marches to the beat of her own drum. I like that."
"Violet's cool, but intimidating as hell. I'm pretty sure she was about to cook one of the brothers for dinner."
"...Then there's Yui. She seems like a really sweet girl. Something about her is so familiar..."
"She said she knew me from before. I'll have to ask her about what I was like before as soon as I can."
"But for now... the show must go on."
